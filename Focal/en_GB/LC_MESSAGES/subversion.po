"     The revision ranges to be merged are specified by the '-r' and/or '-c'\n"

"     single revisions: '-c M' is equivalent to '-r <M-1>:M'. Each such\n"
"     difference is applied to TARGET_WCPATH.\n"
"\n"
"     If the mergeinfo in TARGET_WCPATH indicates that revisions within the\n"
"     range were already merged, changes made in those revisions are not\n"
"     merged again. If needed, the range is broken into multiple sub-ranges,\n"
"     and each sub-range is merged separately.\n"
"\n"
"     A 'reverse range' can be used to undo changes. For example, when\n"
"     source and target refer to the same branch, a previously committed\n"
"     revision can be 'undone'. In a reverse range, N is greater than M in\n"
"     '-r N:M', or the '-c' option is used with a negative number: '-c -M'\n"
"     is equivalent to '-r M:<M-1>'. Undoing changes like this is also known\n"
"     as performing a 'reverse merge'.\n"

"\n"
"  To prevent unnecessary merge conflicts, svn merge requires that\n"

"  If possible, you should have no local modifications in the merge's target\n"
"  working copy prior to the merge, to keep things simpler. It will be\n"

"\n"
"  Switched sub-paths should also be avoided during merging, as they may\n"
"  cause incomplete merges and create subtree mergeinfo.\n"
"\n"
"  For each merged item a line will be printed with characters reporting the\n"
"  action taken. These characters have the following meaning:\n"
"\n"
"    A  Added\n"
"    D  Deleted\n"
"    U  Updated\n"

"  Characters in the second column report about properties of the item.\n"
"  A 'C' in the third column indicates a tree conflict, while a 'C' in\n"
"  the first and second columns indicate textual conflicts in files\n"
"  and in property values, respectively.\n"
"\n"
"    - Merge Tracking -\n"
"\n"
"  Subversion uses the svn:mergeinfo property to track merge history. This\n"
"  property is considered at the start of a merge to determine what to merge\n"
"  and it is updated at the conclusion of the merge to describe the merge\n"
"  that took place. Mergeinfo is used only if the two sources are on the\n"
"  same line of history -- if the first source is an ancestor of the second,\n"
"  or vice-versa (i.e. if one has originally been created by copying the\n"
"  other). This is verified and enforced when using sync merges and\n"
"  reintegrate merges.\n"
"\n"
"  The --ignore-ancestry option prevents merge tracking and thus ignores\n"
"  mergeinfo, neither considering it nor recording it.\n"
"\n"
"    - Merging from foreign repositories -\n"
"\n"
"  Subversion does support merging from foreign repositories.\n"
"  While all merge source URLs must point to the same repository, the merge\n"
"  target working copy may come from a different repository than the source.\n"
"  However, there are some caveats. Most notably, copies made in the\n"
"  merge source will be transformed into plain additions in the merge\n"
"  target. Also, merge-tracking is not supported for merges from foreign\n"

"\n"
"       svn merge [-c M[,N...] | -r N:M ...] SOURCE[@REV] [TARGET_WCPATH]\n"
"\n"
"     A cherry-pick merge is used to merge specific revisions (or revision\n"
"     ranges) from one branch to another. By default, this uses merge\n"
"     tracking to automatically skip any revisions that have already been\n"
"     merged to the target; you can use the --ignore-ancestry option to\n"
"     disable such skipping.\n"
"\n"
"     SOURCE is usually a URL. The optional '@REV' specifies only the peg\n"
"     revision of the URL and does not affect the merge range; if REV is not\n"
"     specified, the HEAD revision is assumed. If SOURCE is a working copy\n"
"     path, the corresponding URL of the path is used, and the default value\n"
"     of 'REV' is the base revision (usually the revision last updated to).\n"
"\n"
"     TARGET_WCPATH is a working copy path; if omitted, '.' is generally\n"
"     assumed. The special cases noted above in the 'complete' merge form\n"
"     also apply here.\n"
"\n"
"     The revision ranges to be merged are specified by the '-r' and/or '-c'\n"
"     options. '-r N:M' refers to the difference in the history of the\n"
"     source branch between revisions N and M. You can use '-c M' to merge\n"
"     single revisions: '-c M' is equivalent to '-r <M-1>:M'. Each such\n"
"     difference is applied to TARGET_WCPATH.\n"
"\n"
"     If the mergeinfo in TARGET_WCPATH indicates that revisions within the\n"
"     range were already merged, changes made in those revisions are not\n"
"     merged again. If needed, the range is broken into multiple sub-ranges,\n"
"     and each sub-range is merged separately.\n"
"\n"
"     A 'reverse range' can be used to undo changes. For example, when\n"
"     source and target refer to the same branch, a previously committed\n"
"     revision can be 'undone'. In a reverse range, N is greater than M in\n"
"     '-r N:M', or the '-c' option is used with a negative number: '-c -M'\n"
"     is equivalent to '-r M:<M-1>'. Undoing changes like this is also known\n"
"     as performing a 'reverse merge'.\n"
"\n"
"     Multiple '-c' and/or '-r' options may be specified and mixing of\n"
"     forward and reverse ranges is allowed.\n"

"\n"

"\n"
"  The following applies to all types of merges:\n"
"\n"
"  To prevent unnecessary merge conflicts, svn merge requires that\n"
"  TARGET_WCPATH is not a mixed-revision working copy. Running 'svn update'\n"
"  before starting a merge ensures that all items in the working copy are\n"
"  based on the same revision.\n"
"\n"
"  If possible, you should have no local modifications in the merge's target\n"
"  working copy prior to the merge, to keep things simpler. It will be\n"
"  easier to revert the merge and to understand the branch's history.\n"
"\n"
"  Switched sub-paths should also be avoided during merging, as they may\n"
"  cause incomplete merges and create subtree mergeinfo.\n"
"\n"
"  For each merged item a line will be printed with characters reporting the\n"
"  action taken. These characters have the following meaning:\n"
"\n"
"    A  Added\n"
"    D  Deleted\n"
"    U  Updated\n"
"    C  Conflict\n"
"    G  Merged\n"
"    E  Existed\n"
"    R  Replaced\n"
"\n"
"  Characters in the first column report about the item itself.\n"
"  Characters in the second column report about properties of the item.\n"
"  A 'C' in the third column indicates a tree conflict, while a 'C' in\n"
"  the first and second columns indicate textual conflicts in files\n"
"  and in property values, respectively.\n"
"\n"
"    - Merge Tracking -\n"
"\n"
"  Subversion uses the svn:mergeinfo property to track merge history. This\n"
"  property is considered at the start of a merge to determine what to merge\n"
"  and it is updated at the conclusion of the merge to describe the merge\n"
"  that took place. Mergeinfo is used only if the two sources are on the\n"
"  same line of history -- if the first source is an ancestor of the second,\n"
"  or vice-versa (i.e. if one has originally been created by copying the\n"
"  other). This is verified and enforced when using sync merges and\n"
"  reintegrate merges.\n"
"\n"
"  The --ignore-ancestry option prevents merge tracking and thus ignores\n"
"  mergeinfo, neither considering it nor recording it.\n"
"\n"
"    - Merging from foreign repositories -\n"
"\n"
"  Subversion does support merging from foreign repositories.\n"
"  While all merge source URLs must point to the same repository, the merge\n"
"  target working copy may come from a different repository than the source.\n"
"  However, there are some caveats. Most notably, copies made in the\n"
"  merge source will be transformed into plain additions in the merge\n"
"  target. Also, merge-tracking is not supported for merges from foreign\n"
"  repositories.\n"
